# Incident Handling Splunk


## Incident Handling Life Cycle

The incident handling process consists of four phases:

![Incident Handling Phases](screenshots/1.png)

1. **Preparation**: Involves readiness activities such as documenting policies, implementing security controls (e.g., EDR, SIEM, IDS/IPS), and training staff.
2. **Detection and Analysis**: Focuses on detecting incidents via alerts from security tools and analyzing them to identify the root cause, including threat hunting for unknown threats.
3. **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**: Involves isolating infected systems, removing infection traces, and restoring normal operations.
4. **Post-Incident Activity / Lessons Learned**: Identifies security gaps, updates detection rules, and improves staff training to prevent future attacks.

## Scenario

Wayne Enterprises experienced a cyber attack where attackers defaced their website `http://www.imreallynotbatman.com`. As a Security Analyst, the task is to investigate the attack using Splunk, which ingests logs from sources like Windows Event Logs (`wineventlog`), Sysmon (`XmlWinEventLog`), Fortinet Firewall (`fortigate_utm`), IIS web server (`iis`), Nessus scans (`Nessus:scan`), Suricata IDS (`suricata`), and network flows (`stream:http`, `stream:DNS`, `stream:icmp`). The goal is to map the attackerâ€™s activities to the seven phases of the Cyber Kill Chain: Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command & Control, and Actions on Objectives.

## Log Sources

Key log sources used in the investigation:
- `wineventlog`: Windows Event Logs.
- `winRegistry`: Registry creation/modification/deletion logs.
- `XmlWinEventLog`: Sysmon logs for process and network activity.
- `fortigate_utm`: Fortinet Firewall logs.
- `iis`: IIS web server logs.
- `Nessus:scan`: Nessus vulnerability scan results.
- `suricata`: Suricata IDS alerts, critical for identifying attack triggers.
- `stream:http`: HTTP network traffic flows.
- `stream:DNS`: DNS network traffic flows.
- `stream:icmp`: ICMP network traffic flows.

## Investigation by Cyber Kill Chain Phases

### Reconnaissance
The attacker gathers information about the target, such as systems, web applications, or employees.
