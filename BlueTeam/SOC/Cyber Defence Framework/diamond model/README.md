# Understanding the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis

The **Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis**, developed by Sergio Caltagirone, Andrew Pendergast, and Christopher Betz in 2013, is a cybersecurity framework that provides a structured approach to analyzing intrusions, breaches, and advanced persistent threats (APTs). It focuses on four core features—**adversary**, **infrastructure**, **capability**, and **victim**—and their relationships, forming a diamond-shaped model. The model is flexible, allowing analysts to integrate additional meta-features and intelligence to enhance threat analysis.

This README offers a comprehensive exploration of the Diamond Model, its components, applications, and practical use in cybersecurity. It is designed as a professional resource to showcase expertise and as an educational tool for learning.

## What is the Diamond Model?

The Diamond Model defines the fundamental elements of any intrusion as a diamond-shaped relationship between adversary, infrastructure, capability, and victim. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of these features, enabling analysts to map events, attribute attacks, and predict adversary behavior. The model also includes optional meta-features (e.g., timestamp, phase) and axes (social-political, technology) to provide context.

### Core Features

1. **Adversary**: The actor or group behind the attack.
2. **Infrastructure**: The physical or logical systems used to deliver capabilities or maintain control.
3. **Capability**: The techniques or tools used to compromise the victim.
4. **Victim**: The target of the attack, including personas and assets.

### Why It Matters

The Diamond Model is valuable for:
- **Intrusion Analysis**: Breaking down complex attacks into manageable components.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Attributing attacks and predicting future actions.
- **Communication**: Explaining incidents to non-technical stakeholders.
- **APT Analysis**: Understanding sophisticated, long-term threats.

## Detailed Breakdown of Core Features

### 1. Adversary

**Definition**: The individual, group, or organization responsible for the attack, also known as the attacker, hacker, or threat actor.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Adversary Operator**: The person(s) conducting the attack (e.g., a hacker executing a phishing campaign).
- **Adversary Customer**: The entity benefiting from the attack (e.g., a criminal group funding the operation).
- Attribution is challenging early in an attack but can be inferred from signatures, TTPs, or intelligence.

**Analytical Use**:
- Identify adversary motives (e.g., financial gain, espionage).
- Track adversary groups using threat intelligence (e.g., **FireEye APT List**).
- Example: An APT group like APT29 (Cozy Bear) targets government agencies for espionage.

### 2. Infrastructure

**Definition**: The hardware, software, or logical systems used to deliver capabilities or maintain control (e.g., C2 servers, malicious domains).

**Key Concepts**:
- **Type 1 Infrastructure**: Owned or controlled by the adversary (e.g., a dedicated C2 server).
- **Type 2 Infrastructure**: Controlled by an intermediary, often unaware (e.g., compromised email accounts).
- **Service Providers**: Organizations like ISPs or domain registrars enabling infrastructure.

**Analytical Use**:
- Map infrastructure to trace attack origins.
- Block malicious IPs or domains.
- Example: A phishing campaign uses a Type 2 compromised email account to send malicious links.

### 3. Capability

**Definition**: The techniques, tools, or skills used to compromise the victim, ranging from simple (e.g., password guessing) to sophisticated (e.g., zero-day exploits).

**Key Concepts**:
- **Capability Capacity**: The vulnerabilities or exposures a capability can exploit.
- **Adversary Arsenal**: The collection of capabilities available to the adversary.

**Analytical Use**:
- Identify tools like malware or phishing kits.
- Develop detection rules for capabilities (e.g., YARA rules for malware).
- Example: A ransomware campaign uses a malicious macro in a Word document to deliver a payload.

### 4. Victim

**Definition**: The target of the attack, including individuals, organizations, or assets like systems and data.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Victim Personae**: People or organizations targeted (e.g., employees, industries).
- **Victim Assets**: Systems, networks, or accounts attacked (e.g., email addresses, servers).

**Analytical Use**:
- Identify attack surfaces (e.g., exposed servers, untrained employees).
- Protect high-value assets with enhanced controls.
- Example: A spearphishing email targets a CFO’s email account to steal financial data.

## Meta-Features

The Diamond Model includes six optional meta-features to enrich analysis:

1. **Timestamp**: Date and time of the event (e.g., `2023-09-12 02:10:12`).
   - Use: Identify attack patterns or time zone differences.
2. **Phase**: The stage of the attack (e.g., reconnaissance, exploitation).
   - Use: Map to frameworks like the Cyber Kill Chain.
3. **Result**: Outcome of the event (e.g., success, failure, unknown).
   - Use: Assess impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
4. **Direction**: The flow of the attack (e.g., victim-to-infrastructure).
   - Use: Analyze network-based events.
5. **Methodology**: The attack type (e.g., phishing, DDoS).
   - Use: Classify incidents for reporting.
6. **Resources**: External requirements (e.g., software, funds).
   - Use: Understand attacker dependencies.

## Axes of the Diamond Model

- **Social-Political**: The adversary’s motives (e.g., financial gain, hacktivism).
  - Example: A hacktivist group targets a corporation to expose unethical practices.
- **Technology**: The relationship between capability and infrastructure.
  - Example: A watering hole attack compromises a legitimate website to deliver malware.

---

## Practical Applications

### Intrusion Analysis
- Map attack components to the Diamond Model to understand the incident.
- Example: A phishing attack involves an adversary (unknown hacker), infrastructure (malicious domain), capability (phishing email), and victim (employee email).

### Threat Intelligence
- Attribute attacks to known threat actors using TTPs and infrastructure.
- Use platforms like **ThreatConnect** or **MISP** to share intelligence.

### Incident Response
- **Containment**: Block infrastructure (e.g., C2 domains).
- **Eradication**: Remove capabilities (e.g., malware).
- **Recovery**: Protect victims with enhanced controls.

### Communication
- Use the model to explain incidents to non-technical stakeholders, focusing on adversary motives and victim impact.

## Real-World Example

**Scenario**: A financial institution suffers a data breach:
- **Adversary**: Unknown criminal group (operator) seeking profit (customer).
- **Infrastructure**: Type 2 compromised email account and a malicious domain (`fakebank.com`).
- **Capability**: Spearphishing email with a malicious attachment exploiting a zero-day vulnerability.
- **Victim**: CFO (persona) and their email account (asset).
- **Meta-Features**:
  - Timestamp: `2023-10-01 09:00:00`.
  - Phase: Delivery and exploitation.
  - Result: Successful data exfiltration.
  - Methodology: Phishing.
- **Axes**:
  - Social-Political: Financial gain.
  - Technology: Phishing email delivered via a compromised SMTP server.

**Defensive Response**:
- Block the malicious domain and email account.
- Patch the exploited vulnerability.
- Train employees on phishing awareness.
- Monitor for similar TTPs using SIEM.
