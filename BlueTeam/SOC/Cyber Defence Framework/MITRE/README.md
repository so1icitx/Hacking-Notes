## What is MITRE?

MITRE is a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) that works across government and industry to address challenges in safety, stability, and well-being. In cybersecurity, MITRE’s mission is to advance threat-informed defense through open-source frameworks, analytics, and emulation plans. Its resources are widely used to map adversary tactics, develop detection rules, and simulate attacks.

## MITRE’s Key Cybersecurity Resources

### 1. MITRE ATT&CK Framework

**Definition**: The **Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK)** framework, launched in 2013, is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It categorizes TTPs used by advanced persistent threats (APTs) and other threat actors.

**Key Features**:
- **Tactics**: The adversary’s goals (e.g., Initial Access, Persistence).
- **Techniques**: How goals are achieved (e.g., Phishing, Credential Dumping).
- **Sub-Techniques**: Specific implementations of techniques.
- **Matrices**: Enterprise, Mobile, and ICS environments.

**Applications**:
- **Threat Hunting**: Map TTPs to detect attacks (e.g., **T1566 - Phishing**).
- **Red Teaming**: Simulate adversary TTPs for testing.
- **Detection**: Develop SIEM rules based on techniques.

**Tools**:
- **ATT&CK Navigator**: Visualize TTPs for groups like APT29.
- **Search Feature**: Query techniques, groups, or tools.

**Example**:
- Analyzing the **Carbanak** group via the ATT&CK Navigator reveals techniques like **T1078 - Valid Accounts** for lateral movement.

### 2. Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR)

**Definition**: The **Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR)** is a knowledge base of analytics aligned with ATT&CK, providing pseudocode and tool-specific queries (e.g., Splunk, EQL) for detecting adversary behavior.

**Key Features**:
- **Analytics**: Validated detection rules (e.g., **CAR-2020-09-001: Scheduled Task - File Access**).
- **Implementations**: Pseudocode and queries for platforms like Splunk or EQL.
- **Sysmon Integration**: Leverages Sysmon for event data.

**Applications**:
- **Detection**: Implement CAR analytics in SIEM for real-time monitoring.
- **Threat Hunting**: Use analytics to identify suspicious behavior.
- **Blue Teaming**: Enhance detection capabilities.

**Example**:
- **CAR-2014-11-004: Remote PowerShell Sessions** provides an EQL query to detect unauthorized PowerShell activity.

### 3. MITRE ENGAGE

**Definition**: **MITRE ENGAGE** is a framework for planning adversary engagement operations using **Cyber Denial** (preventing adversary operations) and **Cyber Deception** (misleading adversaries).

**Key Features**:
- **Matrix**: Categories like Prepare, Expose, Affect, Elicit, and Understand.
- **Starter Kit**: Whitepapers and methodologies for implementation.
- **ATT&CK Integration**: Filters operations by ATT&CK techniques.

**Applications**:
- **Deception**: Deploy decoy assets to mislead attackers.
- **Engagement**: Expose adversary TTPs through controlled interactions.
- **Planning**: Prepare defenses based on adversary behavior.

**Example**:
- Deploying a decoy file to detect unauthorized access aligns with the **Expose** category.

### 4. D3FEND

**Definition**: **D3FEND** (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense) is a knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasures, currently in beta and funded by the NSA.

**Key Features**:
- **Artifacts**: 408 countermeasures (e.g., **Decoy File**).
- **Structure**: Defines techniques, how they work, and implementation examples.
- **ATT&CK Mapping**: Aligns countermeasures with ATT&CK techniques.

**Applications**:
- **Defense Planning**: Select countermeasures for specific threats.
- **Research**: Explore evolving defensive strategies.
- **Integration**: Combine with ATT&CK for holistic defense.

**Example**:
- The **Decoy File** artifact outlines how to deploy fake files to detect intrusions.

### 5. ATT&CK Emulation Plans (AEP)

**Definition**: **ATT&CK Emulation Plans**, part of the **Adversary Emulation Library** by the **Center for Threat-Informed Defense (CTID)**, provide step-by-step guides to mimic specific threat groups (e.g., APT3, APT29, FIN6).

**Key Features**:
- **Emulations**: Detailed plans for red team simulations.
- **CTID Collaboration**: Contributions from companies like Microsoft and AttackIQ.
- **Open-Source**: Freely available for blue and red teams.

**Applications**:
- **Red Teaming**: Simulate APT attacks to test defenses.
- **Blue Teaming**: Assess detection capabilities against real-world TTPs.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Understand group-specific TTPs.

**Example**:
- The **APT29 Emulation Plan** guides teams to mimic techniques like **T1078 - Valid Accounts** for lateral movement.

### 6. Center for Threat-Informed Defense (CTID)

**Definition**: The **CTID** is a MITRE-led organization collaborating with companies like Microsoft, Splunk, and Red Canary to research cyber threats and share open-source solutions.

**Key Features**:
- **Research**: Expands ATT&CK with datasets and TTPs.
- **Projects**: Includes AEP and other threat-informed defense initiatives.
