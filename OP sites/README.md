# OP Sites

This README compiles a list of useful websites for penetration testing, security research, and CTF challenges. These resources provide tools, exploits, documentation, and utilities to aid in various stages of hacking and learning.

---

## Reverse Shells
- **[RevShells](https://www.revshells.com/)**  
  A web-based tool for generating reverse shell payloads in various languages (e.g., Bash, Python, PHP). Useful for establishing remote access during pentesting.

---

## Privilege Escalation
- **[GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/)**  
  A curated list of Unix binaries that can be exploited to bypass local security restrictions and escalate privileges. Essential for post-exploitation phases.

---

## Enumeration Tools
- **[Enum4linux (Kali Docs)](https://www.kali.org/tools/enum4linux/)**  
  Official Kali Linux documentation for `enum4linux`, a tool for enumerating information from Windows and Samba systems (e.g., users, shares).

---

## Kali Linux Tools
- **[Kali Tools](https://www.kali.org/tools/)**  
  The official Kali Linux tools directory, listing hundreds of pre-installed pentesting tools with descriptions and usage guides.

---

## Web Shells
- **[R57Shell](https://www.r57shell.net/)**  
  A resource for web shells (e.g., PHP backdoors) that can be uploaded to compromised servers for remote control. Use responsibly and legally.

---

## Security Training
- **[101 Labs - CompTIA Security+](https://www.101labs.net/comptia-security/)**  
  Practical labs and tutorials for CompTIA Security+ certification, covering foundational security concepts and hands-on exercises.

---

## Exploit Database
- **[Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)**  
  A comprehensive archive of exploits and vulnerable software, maintained by Offensive Security. Great for finding PoCs and CVEs.

---

## Encoding/Decoding Utilities
- **[Base64 Encoder/Decoder](https://appdevtools.com/base64-encoder-decoder)**  
  A simple online tool for encoding and decoding Base64 strings, useful for analyzing encoded data during CTFs or pentests.

---

## Hashing and Cracking
- **[SRI Hash Generator](https://www.srihash.org/)**  
  Generates Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes for securing web resources, though also useful for general hash generation (e.g., SHA256).
- **[CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/)**  
  A free online hash cracker supporting MD5, SHA1, and more. Ideal for cracking simple hashes found during engagements.
- **[Hashes.com](https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash)**  
  Another hash identification and cracking service, supporting a wide range of hash types with a large database.

---

## Blockchain Explorer
- **[Blockchain.com Explorer](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/)**  
  A tool for exploring Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash blockchain data. Useful for investigating cryptocurrency-related challenges or forensics.

## Usage Tips
- **Bookmark these sites**: Keep them handy in your browser for quick access during CTFs or pentesting engagements.
- **Legal Disclaimer**: Use these resources ethically and only on systems you have permission to test. Unauthorized access is illegal.
- **Combine Tools**: Pair sites like GTFOBins with Exploit-DB for effective privilege escalation, or use RevShells with hash crackers for comprehensive attacks.
